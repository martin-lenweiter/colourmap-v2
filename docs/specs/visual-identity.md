# Visual Identity

> The visual soul of Colourmap. A 1949 American typewriter and handwritten letter met a Japanese zen monk at a crossroads. They're still talking.

## The Spine

Colourmap lives at the intersection of three traditions:

- **American 1949 typewriter** — mechanical warmth, Remington / Royal / Underwood era. Monospaced serifs, heavy ink, cream paper, deliberate pacing. Structure.
- **Handwritten letters** — fountain pen in royal blue or sepia, slightly imperfect cursive, marginalia, signatures, folded edges, coffee rings. Blood.
- **Japanese zen** — negative space (*ma*), asymmetry (*fukinsei*), simplicity (*kanso*), naturalness (*shizen*), imperfection (*wabi-sabi*). Breath.

These three traditions share what Colourmap must share: **restraint, weathering, warmth, deliberate pacing, handmade feeling.** They contrast where Colourmap must have tension: **mechanical structure vs. human softness vs. empty space.**

The design identity lives in that tension. The typewriter gives you skeleton. Handwriting gives you blood. Zen gives you the space to hear both.

## Other Voices We Keep

The existing references in the product doc still belong — they're the same aesthetic family, seen from different rooms:

- **Leonardo da Vinci's notebook** — studied annotations, hand-drawn diagrams, sepia ink, marginalia, the inventor's eye
- **Pirate captain's logbook** — weathered parchment, compass rose, nautical authority, navigational intent
- **Cowboy / American old printing press** — display letterforms for emphatic moments, wanted-poster gravitas, frontier type
- **Field journal / drafted paper** — grid lines, rulers, hand-measured sections, the scientist's care

These are not alternatives to the 1949+zen spine. They are **moods within it**. A pirate logbook is a handwritten letter written at sea. A Leonardo notebook is a typewritten page annotated by a genius. A cowboy poster is a typewritten headline inked by hand. They all use paper, ink, and space the same way.

**Rule:** Use these voices as accents and moments, never as a wholesale theme that drowns the spine. The app should always feel like a 1949 typewriter on a tatami mat before it feels like a pirate ship.

## Typography — Three Voices

All type on the page comes from one of three voices. No sans-serif ever. The instant mark of generic SaaS.

### 1. Typewriter serif — structure

- **Examples:** Courier Prime, Special Elite, IBM Plex Mono (serif variant)
- **Speaks:** with authority, slightly imperfect
- **Use for:** labels, timestamps, section headings, system text, uppercase eyebrows (`CURRENT OBJECTIVE`, `LOGBOOK`, `PRESENCE`)
- **Feeling:** mechanical warmth, ink slightly bleeding into paper, each letter deliberate

### 2. Handwritten ink — humanity

- **Examples:** Caveat, Kalam, Homemade Apple, Sacramento
- **Speaks:** with you
- **Use for:** reflections, notes, emotions, objectives the user has written, observations, logbook entries — anything personal
- **Feeling:** fountain pen on cream paper, imperfect loops, a letter to yourself

### 3. Refined serif — ceremony

- **Examples:** Playfair Display, Cormorant Garamond
- **Speaks:** ceremonially
- **Use for:** chapter titles, poetic anchors, emphatic moments, key category names when neither typewriter nor handwriting fits
- **Feeling:** a dedication page, a name carved in stone, the title of a codex

### Cowboy / Display serif — signature moments

Sparingly, for identity beats. Western display letterforms, old printing press, wanted-poster type. Only for moments that deserve it — never as body text.

### Pairing rules

- **Labels typewriter, content handwritten.** Pill: typewriter. What's inside: handwritten. The structure speaks in typewriter, the human speaks in ink.
- **One refined serif moment per view.** Like a fountain pen signature — it loses weight if used everywhere.
- **Never mix two handwritten fonts in the same view.** Pick one ink color, one hand.

## Color Palette

60% paper · 30% ink · 10% accent.

### Paper (60%)

- **Primary cream:** `#F5ECDC` — aged, softly warm
- **Deeper parchment:** `#EDE4CE` — surfaces within surfaces
- **Golden warmth:** `#F2E8D2` — hover states, gentle gradients
- **Never pure white.** Pure white is the death of this aesthetic.

### Ink (30%)

- **Primary ink:** `#5C3018` — deep sepia brown, not pure black
- **Deeper ink:** `#3A2416` — for emphatic text
- **Sumi ink gray:** `#8A6A4A` — secondary text, fine rules
- **Fine rule gray:** `#8A6A4A40` — hairlines
- **Never pure black.** Pure black breaks the paper illusion.

### Accent (10% — one at a time, never more)

- **Ochre gold:** `#C4A060` — the primary accent, the losange, pills, section eyebrows
- **Pen blue:** `#3A5A7A` or `#6890B0` — a single fountain-pen emphasis
- **Bamboo green:** `#7AAA58` — completion, flow, done checkmarks (used sparingly)
- **Deep red-brown:** `#D4805A` — challenge, warning, alert (very sparing)
- **Zen violet:** `#9B6BA0` — reflection, decomposition (reserved for deep work)

### Rule

Any given view uses **one ochre accent plus at most one secondary accent**. Never three accents fighting on the same surface.

## Zen Principles (Spatial)

### Ma (間) — negative space as presence

Every section earns its emptiness. Whitespace is not what's left over — it IS the design. A sparse page of Colourmap should feel like a tatami room: nothing is missing.

**Practical:**
- Sections separated by ≥ 32px vertical space
- Related elements grouped tightly (8–16px)
- Unrelated elements spaced far (24–48px)
- Never fill every pixel. The blank space is the breath.

### Fukinsei (不均整) — deliberate asymmetry

Perfect symmetry feels mechanical. Slight asymmetry feels alive.

- A losange tilted a few degrees
- A line slightly off-horizontal
- A dot off-center by one pixel
- Cells that don't align to a rigid grid
- The eye should have to move

### Kanso (簡素) — simplicity

One primary thing per view. Never shout. When in doubt, remove.

### Shizen (自然) — naturalness

Shapes should feel drawn, not extruded. Borders should have slight wobble. Edges should be softened. The page should look like something a hand made, not a machine rendered.

### Wabi-sabi — beauty in imperfection

- Paper grain visible on surfaces
- Ink that appears slightly uneven
- Hand-drawn rules with small wobble
- Shadows warm and diffuse, never hard-edged
- A corner crease here, a coffee ring there — not literal, but the feeling

## Texture Layer

These are the small details that lift the aesthetic from "clean minimal" to "lived-in codex."

### Paper grain
Subtle parchment texture on card backgrounds. Not a loud pattern — a noise-level texture that makes the surface feel physical.

### Hand-drawn rules
Borders and dividers should have very slight variation — a hand-inked line, not a CSS border. Can be faked with SVG strokes or dashed hairlines.

### The losange (◇)
The signature motif. A small diamond. Used as:
- Section dividers (between blocks of content)
- Toggle buttons and expand gateways
- Accent marks at the end of entries
- Plus-button shape
- Corner flourishes

Always rotated 45°. Always small. Always warm ochre.

### Marginalia
Small hand-drawn elements at the corners or margins — a star, a hatch, a flourish, a wave line. Rare but present. Like a marginal note on a 17th-century manuscript.

### Seals and stamps
For milestones or completed states. A small round stamp in bamboo green. Used once in a great while.

## Motion

Slow. Deliberate. A brush stroke, not a bounce.

- **Duration:** 250–350ms for most transitions; 500ms for contemplative moments (breathing, state changes)
- **Easing:** natural curves (ease-in-out), never spring or bounce
- **Fades over transforms.** Opacity shifts are gentler than movement.
- **Hover:** restrained opacity or color shift, never scale-up more than 1.05x
- **Save confirmations:** soft pulse or gentle color change, never a flash
- **Reveal:** content fades in, never slides abruptly

The motion should feel like a page being turned, not a switch being flipped.

## Forbidden

Things that break the aesthetic instantly. Avoid unless a specific exception is documented.

- **Sans-serif fonts** — the signal of generic SaaS
- **Pure black (#000)** — no paper ever contains pure black ink
- **Pure white (#FFF)** — no paper ever was pure white
- **Hard-edged drop shadows** — shadows should be warm, soft, diffuse
- **Bouncy animation (spring, elastic)** — violates the deliberate pacing
- **Emoji as decoration** — breaks the handmade feel (user-typed emoji in entries is fine)
- **Neon or saturated tech colors** — electric blue, hot pink, lime green, Slack purple
- **Gradients that feel digital** — rainbow, holographic, glassmorphic
- **Iconography in a modern material style** — feather icons are OK; Material Design icons break the voice
- **Loud CSS transitions** — `transform: rotate(360deg)` spins, confetti effects
- **Rounded "pill" buttons that feel Stripe-like** — pills are allowed but must feel paper-stamped, not glossy

| Losange toggles | Ochre diamond, no text |
| Step Back / breathing moments | Handwritten "saved", refined serif instructions |
| Error / validation | Typewriter serif, deep red-brown |

## Check Before Shipping UI

Before any UI PR lands, look at the screen and ask:

1. Does it feel like **paper, ink, and space** — or like a dashboard?
2. Is there **one primary thing** the eye goes to first?
3. Is there **enough emptiness** that the content breathes?
4. Are there **three voices at most** (typewriter, handwritten, refined), used deliberately?
5. Does **one accent color** lead, with at most one secondary?
6. Could you imagine this page in a **1949 letter**, a **Leonardo notebook**, and a **tea ceremony room** — and all three say yes?

If any answer is no, pause and revise.
